## #FreeYourAndroid

Change proprietary apps on your Android phone to FOSS alternatives.

Also you can change stock ROM to custom ROM without Google Play Services (GApps).

## OS

Change Windows or MacOS to GNU/Linux, BSD or any other FOSS operating system.

## Other tips

* Encrypt your files and mails with [GPG](https://gnupg.org/) encryption.
* If you can, use [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) instead of VPN services.
